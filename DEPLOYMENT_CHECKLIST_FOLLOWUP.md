## Deployment Steps (In Order)

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Backup
```bash
# Backup current database
mysqldump -u root -p healthcare_crm > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Backup current app files
cp -r /path/to/app /path/to/app_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```
**Verify**: Backup files exist and are readable
- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Code backup created

### Step 2: Apply Database Migration
```bash
# Execute SQL migration
mysql -u root -p healthcare_crm < FOLLOWUP_ENHANCEMENT.sql

# Verify migration success
mysql -u root -p healthcare_crm -e "DESCRIBE followups;"
mysql -u root -p healthcare_crm -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM followups;"
```
**Verify**: New columns present without errors
- [ ] No SQL errors
- [ ] New columns visible (follow_up_time, next_follow_up_date, etc.)
- [ ] Existing data preserved
- [ ] Indexes created

### Step 3: Deploy Code
```bash
# Stop application (if running as service)
sudo systemctl stop leadflow-crm    # or equivalent

# Deploy new app.py
cp app.py /production/path/app.py

# Deploy updated templates
cp templates/*.html /production/path/templates/

# Copy new template
cp templates/add-next-followup.html /production/path/templates/

# Verify file permissions
ls -la /production/path/app.py      # Should have correct permissions
ls -la /production/path/templates/  # Should be readable
```
**Verify**: Files copied without errors
- [ ] app.py deployed
- [ ] All templates deployed
- [ ] add-next-followup.html deployed
- [ ] File permissions correct (readable by app)

### Step 4: Start Application
```bash
# Start application
sudo systemctl start leadflow-crm    # or equivalent

# Check application status
sudo systemctl status leadflow-crm

# Verify application listening
netstat -tlnp | grep 5000            # or appropriate port

# Check logs for errors
tail -f /var/log/leadflow-crm/app.log
```
**Verify**: Application started without errors
- [ ] Service running
- [ ] No startup errors in logs
- [ ] Application responsive
- [ ] Database connection working

### Step 5: Functional Testing
```
Test 1: Appointment Display
- Navigate to /appointments
- Verify newly created appointment appears
- Check date and time display correctly

Test 2: Follow-Up with Time
- Create new follow-up for completed appointment
- Verify time field required and accepted
- Check time displays in followups list

Test 3: Next Follow-Up
- Mark follow-up as DONE
- Click Next button
- Schedule next follow-up
- Verify both follow-ups exist

Test 4: Invoice from Follow-Up
- Mark appointment as COMPLETED
- Create and mark follow-up as DONE
- Click Invoice button
- Verify invoice created

Test 5: RBAC for Doctor
- Login as doctor
- Verify only own appointments visible
- Try to access other doctor's follow-up (should deny)
```

**Verify**: All tests pass
- [ ] Appointment display works
- [ ] Follow-up time works
- [ ] Next follow-up works
- [ ] Invoice button works
- [ ] RBAC enforced

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Application Health Checks
```bash
# Check application logs for errors
tail -f /var/log/leadflow-crm/app.log

# Check database connectivity
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM followups;"

# Verify all routes accessible
curl -s http://localhost:5000/appointments | head -20
curl -s http://localhost:5000/followups | head -20
```

### ✅ Performance Checks
- [ ] Application response time normal (< 1 second per page)
- [ ] Database queries still fast
- [ ] No memory leaks visible
- [ ] No obvious slow operations

### ✅ Data Integrity Checks
```sql
-- Check patient_id populated in follow-ups
SELECT COUNT(*) as total, 
       COUNT(patient_id) as with_patient_id
FROM followups;

-- Should show both counts equal or most have patient_id

-- Check no follow-ups created without proper links
SELECT f.followup_id
FROM followups f
WHERE f.patient_id IS NULL AND f.appointment_id IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;

-- Should return minimal results (old data before migration)
```

### ✅ User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Admin user can see all appointments
- [ ] Doctor user can see only own appointments
- [ ] Follow-ups page shows new time column
- [ ] Follow-up creation accepts time
- [ ] Next follow-up feature works
- [ ] Invoice button works from follow-up page
- [ ] No error messages on main pages
- [ ] No 404 errors on routes

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Found)

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Stop application
sudo systemctl stop leadflow-crm

# Restore previous code
rm -rf /production/path/*
cp -r /production/path_backup_[timestamp]/* /production/path/

# Start application
sudo systemctl start leadflow-crm
```

### Database Rollback
```bash
# If data corruption, restore from backup
mysql -u root -p healthcare_crm < backup_[timestamp].sql

# Verify restoration
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM followups;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices;
```

### Verification After Rollback
- [ ] Application running
- [ ] Database restored
- [ ] Data integrity verified
- [ ] Previous functionality working
- [ ] Logs checked for errors

## Known Issues & Mitigations

### Issue 1: New Columns Appear NULL
**Cause**: Migration not run properly
**Fix**:
- Verify migration executed without errors
- Check followups table structure: `DESCRIBE followups;`
- Re-run migration if needed

### Issue 2: Follow-Up Time Not Saving
**Cause**: Form not submitting time, or database column issue
**Fix**:
- Verify form includes follow_up_time field
- Check database column type is TIME
- Review browser console for JavaScript errors
- Check application logs

### Issue 3: Appointments Showing Old Errors
**Cause**: Template caching or old query still running
**Fix**:
- Clear browser cache
- Restart Flask application
- Verify app.py has LEFT JOINs (not INNER JOINs)

### Issue 4: RBAC Access Denied
**Cause**: Doctor ID not mapping correctly
**Fix**:
- Verify users.doctor_id is populated: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE role='DOCTOR';`
- Check doctor record exists: `SELECT * FROM doctors WHERE doctor_id = X;`
- Review RBAC check in route logs

## Monitoring After Deployment
