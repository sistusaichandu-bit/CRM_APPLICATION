# Appointment Module Implementation - Complete Guide

## Overview
Production-ready appointment management system for LeadFlow CRM with strict role-based security, lead validation, and invoice creation hooks.

---

## 1️⃣ Backend Routes Implemented

### Route: POST /create-appointment/<lead_id>
**File:** [app.py](app.py#L724-L842)

**GET Request - Load Form:**
- Validates lead exists and status = 'CONVERTED' (required)
- Fetches lead details: name, service, assigned_to, status
- Security check for DOCTOR role: Can only create for their own assigned leads
- Displays form with auto-filled lead information
- Returns: `create-appointment.html` template

**POST Request - Create Appointment:**
- Collects: appointment_date, appointment_time, notes
- Validates required fields
- Uses parameterized query to insert into appointments table
- Stores: lead_id, doctor_id, service, appointment_date, appointment_time, status='SCHEDULED', notes
- Redirects to `/appointments` on success

**Security Features:**
✅ DOCTOR can only create for their own leads  
✅ ADMIN can create for any converted lead  
✅ Validates lead.status = 'CONVERTED' before allowing appointment  
✅ Uses @login_required decorator  
✅ Parameterized queries (SQL injection safe)  
✅ Proper error handling with rollback  

---

### Route: GET /appointments
**File:** [app.py](app.py#L845-L919)

**Functionality:**
- Lists all appointments with role-based filtering
- Joins with leads and doctors tables for display data

**DOCTOR Role:**
- Shows only their appointments: `WHERE doctor_id = their_doctor_id`
- Fetches doctor_id from users table via session email
- Cannot see other doctors' appointments

**ADMIN Role:**
- Shows all appointments
- Full visibility across system

**Response Data:**
```
- appointment_id
- patient_name (from leads)
- doctor_name (from doctors)
- service
- appointment_date
- appointment_time
- status (SCHEDULED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
- notes
- created_at
```

**Ordering:** `ORDER BY appointment_date DESC`

---

### Route: POST /update-appointment-status/<appointment_id>/<new_status>
**File:** [app.py](app.py#L922-L1014)

**Functionality:**
- Updates appointment status to either COMPLETED or CANCELLED
- Validates new_status is in allowed set
- Updates updated_at timestamp

**DOCTOR Security:**
- Can only update their own appointments
- Fetches doctor_id from users table
- Validates appointment belongs to them

**ADMIN:**
- Can update any appointment

**Invoice Creation Hook:**
```python
# TODO: When status becomes COMPLETED, trigger invoice creation logic here
# This could be:
# 1. Direct call to invoice creation
# 2. Queue a background job
# 3. Set a flag for batch processing
app.logger.info(f"Appointment {appointment_id} marked COMPLETED - ready for invoice generation")
```

**Response:** Redirects to `/appointments` with success/error flash message

---

## 2️⃣ Frontend Templates

### Template: create-appointment.html
**File:** [templates/create-appointment.html](templates/create-appointment.html)

**Display:**

  - Patient Name
  - Service
  - Doctor
  - Status badge (green CONVERTED)

- Form section:

  - Appointment Time (required, time input)
  - Notes (textarea, optional)

**Buttons:**

---

### Template: appointments.html (Updated)
**File:** [templates/appointments.html](templates/appointments.html)

**Table Columns:**
| Column | Source | Format |
|--------|--------|--------|
| ID | appointment_id | #123 |
| Patient Name | leads.name | Text |
| Doctor Name | doctors.name | Text |
| Service | appointments.service | Text |
| Date | appointment_date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Time | appointment_time | HH:MM |
| Status | appointments.status | Badge (colored) |

- **✕ Cancel** (red) - If status ≠ CANCELLED, marks as CANCELLED

**Empty State:**
```
No appointments found. Create one from a converted lead
```

---

### Template: leads.html (Updated)
**File:** [templates/leads.html](templates/leads.html)

**New Action Button:**
```html
<!-- Create Appointment button: visible only for CONVERTED leads -->
## 2️⃣ Frontend Templates

### Template: leads.html (Updated)
{% if lead.status == 'CONVERTED' %}
  <a href="{{ url_for('convert_to_appointment', lead_id=lead.lead_id) }}" 
       class="text-xs bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white px-2 py-1 rounded">
        📅 Appointment
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

**Button Visibility:**
- Shows only for leads with status = 'CONVERTED'
- Green color for consistency
- Links to create-appointment form

---

## 3️⃣ Database Schema Requirements

The implementation expects these tables and columns:

**appointments table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE appointments (
    appointment_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    lead_id INT NOT NULL,
    doctor_id INT NOT NULL,
    service VARCHAR(100),
    appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    appointment_time TIME NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('SCHEDULED', 'COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED'),
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (lead_id) REFERENCES leads(lead_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(doctor_id)
);
```

---

## 4️⃣ Workflow Rules

### Appointment Creation Flow:
1. User views leads page
2. Finds a CONVERTED lead
3. Clicks "📅 Appointment" button
4. System validates:
   - Lead exists
   - Lead status = 'CONVERTED'
   - User is DOCTOR and owns lead OR user is ADMIN
5. Form loads with auto-filled lead information
6. User fills appointment date, time, optional notes
7. Submits form
8. Appointment created in database
9. Redirects to appointments list

### Appointment Status Flow:
```
SCHEDULED → ✓ Done → COMPLETED
   ↓
   └─ ✕ Cancel → CANCELLED
   (or from COMPLETED)
```

---

## 5️⃣ Security Implementation

✅ **Role-Based Access Control:**
- DOCTOR: Only see/manage their own appointments
- ADMIN: See/manage all appointments

✅ **Lead Validation:**
- Appointment creation restricted to CONVERTED leads
- Status validation prevents invalid transitions

✅ **Doctor Privacy:**
- DOCTOR cannot view other doctors' appointments
- DOCTOR cannot update other doctors' appointments
- Database queries filter by doctor_id

✅ **SQL Injection Prevention:**
- All queries use parameterized statements
- No string concatenation in SQL

✅ **Authentication:**
- All routes use @login_required decorator
- Session validation for role checks

✅ **Error Handling:**
- Try-catch blocks with proper rollback
- Flash messages for user feedback
- Logging for debugging

---

## 6️⃣ Invoice Creation Hook

When appointment status becomes COMPLETED:

```python
if new_status == 'COMPLETED':
    # TODO: Trigger invoice creation logic here
    # This could be:
    # 1. Direct call to invoice creation
    # 2. Queue a background job
    # 3. Set a flag for batch processing
    app.logger.info(f"Appointment {appointment_id} marked COMPLETED - ready for invoice generation")
```

**Integration Points:**
- Hook is positioned in `/update-appointment-status` route
- Executes after successful database commit
- Has access to appointment_id and related data
- Can be replaced with async job queue (Celery, RQ, etc.)

---

## 7️⃣ Code Quality Features

✅ **Production-Ready:**
- Proper error handling with try-catch-finally
- Resource cleanup (cursor/connection closing)
- Flash messages for user feedback
- Detailed logging for debugging

✅ **Best Practices:**
- Dictionary cursor for clean data access
- Parameterized queries for security
- Proper HTTP method usage (GET/POST)
- RESTful route naming

✅ **User Experience:**
- Intuitive appointment creation flow
- Clear status badges with color coding
- Confirmation dialogs before status changes
- Empty state messaging

## 8️⃣ Testing Checklist

### Test Cases:

```bash
□ DOCTOR Test:

  4. Form loads with pre-filled lead info
  5. Fill date, time, notes
  6. Submit form
  7. Appointment appears in /appointments
  8. Try to access COMPLETED button - view should show

□ DOCTOR Security Test:
  1. Try to access /create-appointment for another doctor's lead
  2. Should redirect with error: "You can only create appointments for your own leads"
  3. Try to update another doctor's appointment
  4. Should redirect with error: "You can only update your own appointments"

□ ADMIN Test:
  1. Login as ADMIN
  2. Access /appointments - see all appointments
  3. Create appointment on any converted lead
  4. Update status on any appointment
  5. All operations should work

□ Lead Validation Test:
  1. Try to create appointment for NEW lead
  2. Should redirect with error: "Appointments can only be created for CONVERTED leads"

□ Database Test:
  1. Verify appointments table exists with correct schema
  2. Check that appointment records have correct: lead_id, doctor_id, service, status
  3. Verify timestamps created/updated correctly
```
