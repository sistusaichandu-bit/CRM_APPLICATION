## 💡 Revenue Calculations Verified

### Invoice Generation
```
✓ amount = 2000.00
✓ tax = amount × 0.18 = 360.00
✓ total_amount = 2000.00 + 360.00 = 2360.00
✓ paid_amount = 0 (initially)
✓ balance_amount = 2360.00
✓ status = 'UNPAID'
✓ invoice_number = auto-generated (INV-2026-XXXX)
```

### Payment Toggle
```
UNPAID → PAID:
✓ paid_amount = total_amount
✓ balance_amount = 0
✓ payment_date = NOW()

PAID → UNPAID:
✓ paid_amount = 0
✓ balance_amount = total_amount
✓ payment_date = NULL
```

### Revenue Summary
```
✓ Total Revenue = SUM(total_amount) WHERE status = 'PAID'
✓ Paid Revenue = SUM(paid_amount) WHERE status = 'PAID'
✓ Pending Revenue = SUM(balance_amount) WHERE status = 'UNPAID'
✓ This Month = SUM(total_amount) WHERE status='PAID' AND MONTH(payment_date)=CURRENT
```

### Doctor Earnings
```
✓ Formula: earning = total_revenue × (commission_percentage ÷ 100)
✓ Example: 100,000 × (35 ÷ 100) = 35,000
✓ Per-doctor commission from database
✓ Dynamic, not hardcoded
```
