## Backend Logic Improvements

### Invoice Generation

#### BEFORE
```python
cursor.execute(
    "INSERT INTO invoices (appointment_id, patient_id, doctor_id, service, amount, tax, total_amount, status, created_at) VALUES (...)",
    (appointment_id, patient_id, doctor_id, service, amount, tax, total_amount, 'UNPAID')
)

# Issues:
# - No invoice number generation
# - No balance tracking
# - Manual amount calculation
# - No professional numbering
```

#### AFTER
```python
# Auto-generate sequential invoice number
cursor.execute("SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(invoice_number, -4) AS UNSIGNED)) AS max_num FROM invoices WHERE invoice_number LIKE 'INV-2026-%'")
next_num = (result['max_num'] or 0) + 1
invoice_number = f'INV-2026-{next_num:04d}'

# Calculate all required fields
amount = 2000.00
tax = round(amount * 0.18, 2)  # 360.00
total_amount = round(amount + tax, 2)  # 2360.00
paid_amount = 0.00  # Initially unpaid
balance_amount = total_amount  # Full balance initially

cursor.execute(
    "INSERT INTO invoices (appointment_id, patient_id, doctor_id, service, amount, tax, total_amount, paid_amount, balance_amount, status, invoice_number, created_at) VALUES (...)",
    (appointment_id, patient_id, doctor_id, service, amount, tax, total_amount, paid_amount, balance_amount, 'UNPAID', invoice_number)
)

# Improvements:
✅ Unique sequential invoice numbers (INV-2026-0001, 0002, etc.)
✅ Automatic balance calculation
✅ Professional standardized amounts
✅ Transactional consistency
✅ Better audit trail
```

### Payment Toggle

#### BEFORE
```python
if new_status == 'PAID':
    cursor.execute("UPDATE invoices SET status = %s, payment_date = NOW() WHERE invoice_id = %s", (new_status, invoice_id))
else:
    cursor.execute("UPDATE invoices SET status = %s, payment_date = NULL WHERE invoice_id = %s", (new_status, invoice_id))

# Issues:
# - Only updates status and date
# - Doesn't track paid amounts
# - No balance calculation
# - Incomplete financial record
```

#### AFTER
```python
# Lock invoice for atomicity
cursor.execute("SELECT invoice_id, status, doctor_id, total_amount FROM invoices WHERE invoice_id = %s FOR UPDATE", (invoice_id,))
inv = cursor.fetchone()

if new_status == 'PAID':
    # Mark as PAID: full payment received
    cursor.execute(
        "UPDATE invoices SET status = %s, paid_amount = %s, balance_amount = %s, payment_date = NOW() WHERE invoice_id = %s",
        ('PAID', inv.get('total_amount'), 0, invoice_id)
    )
else:
    # Mark as UNPAID: revert to outstanding
    cursor.execute(
        "UPDATE invoices SET status = %s, paid_amount = %s, balance_amount = %s, payment_date = NULL WHERE invoice_id = %s",
        ('UNPAID', 0, inv.get('total_amount'), invoice_id)
    )

# Improvements:
✅ Atomic transaction with row locking
✅ Tracks paid_amount and balance_amount
✅ Consistent financial calculations
✅ Payment date properly recorded
✅ Safe concurrent access
✅ Complete audit trail
```

### Revenue Calculation

#### BEFORE
```python
# Simple queries
cursor.execute("SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount),0) AS total FROM invoices WHERE status = 'PAID'")
total_revenue = cursor.fetchone()['total']

# Issues:
# - Only shows paid total
# - No breakdown by payment status
# - No monthly trends
# - Missing perspectives
```

#### AFTER
```python
# Comprehensive financial dashboard
total_revenue = SUM(total_amount) WHERE status = 'PAID'
paid_revenue = SUM(paid_amount) WHERE status = 'PAID'
pending_revenue = SUM(balance_amount) WHERE status = 'UNPAID'
this_month_revenue = SUM(total_amount) WHERE status = 'PAID' AND MONTH(payment_date) = CURRENT_MONTH

# Improvements:
✅ Multi-perspective financial view
✅ Real-time revenue tracking
✅ Outstanding amount visibility
✅ Monthly trend analysis
✅ Cash flow forecasting support
```

### Doctor Earnings

#### BEFORE
```python
# Hardcoded commission
commission = 0.40  # Fixed 40%
earning = round(total_revenue * commission, 2)

# Issues:
# - Fixed commission for all doctors
# - No flexibility for different rates
# - No transparency in calculation
# - Difficult to update
```

#### AFTER
```python
# Dynamic commission from doctors table
commission_pct = float(doctor['commission_percentage'] or 40)  # Default 40
earning = round(total_revenue * commission_pct / 100, 2)

# Improvements:
✅ Per-doctor commission flexibility
✅ Transparent calculation formula
✅ Easy admin updates
✅ Default fallback value
✅ Supports variable terms
✅ Professional earnings reporting
```
