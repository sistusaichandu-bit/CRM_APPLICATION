# Invoice Generation from Appointments - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Successfully implemented appointment-to-invoice integration for the Healthcare CRM system. Completed appointments can now generate invoices automatically with role-based access control.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Appointments Page Enhancement** 
**File:** `templates/appointments.html`

#### New Action Buttons in Actions Column:
- **💰 Invoice Button** (Blue) 
  - Shows for COMPLETED appointments when NO invoice exists
  - Style: `bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600`
  - Links to `/generate-invoice/<appointment_id>`
  
- **✓ Invoice Badge** (Gray)
  - Shows for COMPLETED appointments when invoice ALREADY exists
  - Style: `bg-gray-300 text-gray-700`
  - Indicates invoice status

#### Updated Appointment Query:
- Added LEFT JOIN with `invoices` table
- Uses SQL CASE statement to detect existing invoices
- Populates `invoice_exists` flag for each appointment

```sql
SELECT 
    a.appointment_id,
    a.lead_id,
    a.doctor_id,
    a.service,
    a.appointment_date,
    a.appointment_time,
    a.status,
    a.notes,
    a.created_at,
    l.name AS patient_name,
    d.name AS doctor_name,
    CASE WHEN i.invoice_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS invoice_exists
FROM appointments a
LEFT JOIN leads l ON a.lead_id = l.lead_id
LEFT JOIN doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
LEFT JOIN invoices i ON a.appointment_id = i.appointment_id
```

---

### 2. **New Route: `/generate-invoice/<int:appointment_id>`**
**File:** `app.py` (Lines 1075+)

#### Route Behavior:
```python
@app.route('/generate-invoice/<int:appointment_id>')
@login_required
def generate_invoice(appointment_id):
    # Generate invoice from completed appointment
```

#### Step-by-Step Logic:

**Step 1: Fetch Appointment Details**
- Uses JOIN with leads table to get patient name
- Validates appointment exists
- Validates appointment status = 'COMPLETED'

**Step 2: Role-Based Access Control**
- **DOCTOR Role:** Can only generate invoices for their own appointments
  - Fetches doctor_id from users table
  - Compares with appointment's doctor_id
  - Rejects if not matching
  
- **ADMIN/STAFF Roles:** Can generate invoices for any appointment
- **Other Roles:** Access denied

**Step 3: Duplicate Prevention**
- Checks if invoice already exists using appointment_id
- Since `appointment_id` is UNIQUE in invoices table, maximum one invoice per appointment
- If exists → Flash message "Invoice already generated"
- Redirects to invoices page

**Step 4: Calculate Financial Values**
```python
amount = 2000.00        # Default service amount
tax = amount * 0.18     # 18% GST/TAX
total_amount = amount + tax  # ₹2,360.00
```

**Step 5: Insert Invoice Record**
Uses parameterized query to prevent SQL injection:
```sql
INSERT INTO invoices 
(appointment_id, patient_id, doctor_id, service, amount, tax, total_amount, status, created_at)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())
```

Values inserted:
- `appointment_id`: From URL parameter
- `patient_id`: lead_id from appointment
- `doctor_id`: From appointment record
- `service`: From appointment record
- `amount`: 2000.00
- `tax`: 360.00
- `total_amount`: 2360.00
- `status`: 'UNPAID' (default)
- `created_at`: Current timestamp

**Step 6: Flash Messages & Redirect**
- Success: "Invoice generated successfully! Amount: ₹2,360.00 (₹2,000.00 + 18% tax ₹360.00)"
- Error: "Error generating invoice. Please try again."
- Duplicate: "Invoice already generated for this appointment."
- Status error: "Invoice can only be generated for COMPLETED appointments."
- Access error: "Access denied. You can only generate invoices for your own appointments."

Redirects to `/invoices` page

## Database Schema (Invoices Table)

| Column | Type | Key | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|-----|---------|-------|
| invoice_id | INT | PK Auto | - | Primary Key |
| appointment_id | INT | UNI | - | Links to appointments (1:1) |
| patient_id | INT | FK | - | Links to leads/patients |
| doctor_id | INT | FK | - | Links to doctors |
| service | VARCHAR(100) | - | - | Service description |
| amount | DECIMAL(10,2) | - | - | Base amount |
| tax | DECIMAL(10,2) | - | 0.00 | Tax amount |
| total_amount | DECIMAL(10,2) | - | - | amount + tax |
| status | ENUM | - | UNPAID | PAID or UNPAID |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | - | NOW | Auto-generated |

**Key Constraint:** `appointment_id` is UNIQUE → Only one invoice per appointment ✓

## Security Features

### ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **DOCTOR**: Limited to own appointments
- **ADMIN/STAFF**: Full access to all appointments

### ✅ Parameterized Queries
- All SQL queries use `%s` placeholders
- Prevents SQL injection attacks
- Automatic escaping by mysql.connector

### ✅ Duplicate Prevention
- Unique constraint on `appointment_id`
- Explicit check before insertion
- Database-level and application-level protection

### ✅ Input Validation
- Appointment existence check
- Status validation (must be COMPLETED)
- Role verification before processing

### ✅ Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for database errors
- Rollback on transaction failure
- Proper connection cleanup in finally blocks
- Logging for audit trail

## User Journey

### For DOCTOR Role:
1. Navigate to `/appointments`
2. Mark appointment as COMPLETED (click "✓ Done")
3. See "💰 Invoice" button appear for that appointment
4. Click button to generate invoice
5. Success message with amount breakdown displayed
6. Redirected to `/invoices` page

### For ADMIN/STAFF Role:
1. Navigate to `/appointments`
2. Verify appointment status is COMPLETED
3. Click "💰 Invoice" button on any completed appointment
4. Invoice generated with success message
5. Redirected to `/invoices` page

### Preventing Duplicates:
1. After invoice is generated, button changes to "✓ Invoice" (gray)
2. Clicking again would show: "Invoice already generated for this appointment"
3. If manually tried via URL, application prevents insertion via unique constraint
