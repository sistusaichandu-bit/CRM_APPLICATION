## Flask Endpoints

### 1. List Follow-Ups

**GET** `/followups`

Returns professional dashboard with follow-up list.

**Parameters**:
- `status` (optional): Filter by 'PENDING' or 'DONE'
- `date` (optional): Show follow-ups from this date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `overdue` (optional): Set to 'on' to show only overdue

**Response Data**:
```python
{
    'followups': [
        {
            'followup_id': 1,
            'appointment_id': 5,
            'doctor_id': 2,
            'followup_date': datetime(2026, 03, 10),
            'notes': 'Check wound healing',

## Integration Points

### 1. Appointment Completion Flow

After marking an appointment as COMPLETED:
```
Appointment Completed
├── Generate Invoice (Optional)
└── Add Follow-Up (Optional)
```

**From Appointments Page**:
- Action button: "📋 Follow-Up" appears on COMPLETED appointments
- Opens `/add-followup/<appointment_id>` form

### 2. Dashboard Integration

Follow-ups page shows:
- Summary cards (Total, Pending, Completed, Overdue)
- Professional table with filtering
- Overdue detection and highlighting
- Quick actions (Mark as Done)

### 3. Template Integration

**appointments.html**: Added follow-up button for completed appointments
**followups.html**: Professional SaaS dashboard
**add-followup.html**: Form for scheduling new follow-ups

---

## UI Components

### Summary Cards

```
┌─────────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌────────────┐
│ Total Follow-Ups│  │   Pending    │  │  Completed   │  │  Overdue   │
│       15        │  │      8       │  │      7       │  │     2      │
│       📋        │  │      ⏳       │  │      ✓       │  │     🔴     │
└─────────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └────────────┘
```

### Status Badges

- **PENDING** (⏳ Amber): Follow-up scheduled but not completed
- **DONE** (✓ Green): Follow-up completed
- **OVERDUE** (🔴 Red): Pending follow-up past due date

### Filters

- Status filter (All, Pending, Done)
- Date range filter (from date)
- Overdue checkbox (show only late follow-ups)

---

## Data Display

### Follow-Up Table Columns

| Column | Description | Format |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| ID | Unique identifier | #1, #2, etc |
| Patient | Patient name | Name |
| Doctor | Responsible doctor | Dr. Name |
| Appointment | Original appointment | dd-mm-yyyy |
| Follow-Up Date | Scheduled date | dd-mm-yyyy (red if overdue) |
| Service | Service type | Text |
| Status | PENDING/DONE | Colored badge |
| Notes | Clinical notes | Truncated text |
| Actions | Quick actions | Complete button |

---

## Smart Logic

### Overdue Calculation

Follow-up is marked **overdue** when:
```
followup_date < TODAY AND status = 'PENDING'
```

Computed field in query:
```sql
CASE WHEN f.followup_date < CURDATE() AND f.status = 'PENDING' 
     THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_overdue
```

### Statistics Query

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'PENDING' THEN 1 END) AS pending,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'DONE' THEN 1 END) AS completed,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN followup_date < CURDATE() AND status = 'PENDING' THEN 1 END) AS overdue
FROM followups
WHERE doctor_id = %s  -- If DOCTOR role
```

---

## Error Handling

### Validation

```python
# Appointment validation
if not appointment:
    flash('Appointment not found.', 'danger')

# Role validation
if user_role == 'DOCTOR' and doctor_id != appointment.doctor_id:
    flash('Access denied.', 'danger')

# Date validation
try:
    datetime.strptime(followup_date, '%Y-%m-%d')
except ValueError:
    flash('Invalid date format.', 'warning')
```

### Exception Handling

All routes use try/except/finally:
```python
try:
    # Execute query
except Error as e:
    app.logger.exception('Database error: %s', e)
    flash('Error...', 'danger')
finally:
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
```

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the schema script:
```bash
mysql -u root -p healthcare_crm < FOLLOWUP_SCHEMA.sql
```

### 2. Verify Table

```sql
DESCRIBE followups;
```

### 3. Test Queries

```sql
-- Find all pending follow-ups
SELECT * FROM followups WHERE status = 'PENDING' ORDER BY followup_date ASC;

-- Find overdue follow-ups
SELECT * FROM followups 
WHERE followup_date < CURDATE() AND status = 'PENDING'
ORDER BY followup_date ASC;

-- Doctor's follow-ups
SELECT * FROM followups 
WHERE doctor_id = 2 
ORDER BY followup_date ASC;
```

### 4. Start Flask App

```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Navigate to Follow-Ups

1. Go to: http://localhost:5000/followups
2. Create appointment if needed
3. Mark as COMPLETED
4. Click "📋 Follow-Up" button
5. Schedule follow-up
6. Manage follow-ups on /followups page

---

## Best Practices

### For Doctors

✓ Schedule follow-ups immediately after completing appointments
✓ Add detailed clinical notes for continuity of care
✓ Check overdue follow-ups regularly
✓ Mark follow-ups as done once completed

### For Admins

✓ Monitor overdue follow-ups
✓ Ensure doctors complete scheduled follow-ups
✓ Use filtering for specific date ranges
✓ Track completion statistics

### Code Quality

✓ All datetime fields properly formatted
✓ Null safety checks before formatting
✓ Role-based access control enforced
✓ Clean exception handling with proper logging
✓ Database connections properly closed

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes

The schema includes optimized indexes:
- `idx_appointment`: Fast appointment lookups
- `idx_doctor`: Filter by doctor
- `idx_status`: Filter by status
- `idx_followup_date`: Sort by date
- `idx_pending_followups`: Quick pending queries
- `idx_overdue_followups`: Fast overdue detection

### Query Optimization

```sql
-- Optimized query with proper indexing
SELECT f.*, p.name AS patient_name, d.name AS doctor_name
FROM followups f
LEFT JOIN appointments a ON f.appointment_id = a.appointment_id
LEFT JOIN patients p ON a.patient_id = p.patient_id
LEFT JOIN doctors d ON f.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
WHERE f.doctor_id = %s 
  AND f.status = 'PENDING'
  AND f.followup_date < CURDATE()
ORDER BY f.followup_date ASC;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Follow-Ups Showing

✓ Check if appointments exist and are marked COMPLETED
✓ Verify DOCTOR role sees only their follow-ups
✓ Check filters aren't hiding results

### Overdue Not Showing

✓ Verify `followup_date` is in the past and status is PENDING
✓ Check date format in database
✓ Run overdue query directly in MySQL

### Access Denied

✓ Verify user role (DOCTOR, ADMIN, STAFF)
✓ DOCTOR should only see own appointments
✓ Check `get_user_doctor_id()` returns correct ID
