# SaaS Financial Module - Implementation Guide & Testing

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Database Schema Update
Run the migration script to add new fields to your invoices table:

```bash
mysql -u root -p healthcare_crm < DATABASE_MIGRATION.sql
```

Verify the update:
```sql
DESCRIBE invoices;
-- Should show: payment_date, payment_method, paid_amount, balance_amount, is_active, invoice_number
```

### Step 2: Restart Flask Application
```bash
python app.py
# or with your preferred method
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000/invoices`

Expected: Professional dashboard with revenue cards, filters, and enhanced table

### ✓ Payment Toggle Functionality
Test switching an invoice between PAID/UNPAID:

1. Create a test invoice from appointment → `/generate-invoice/`
2. Verify created with status=UNPAID, paid_amount=0, balance_amount=total
3. Click "Mark Paid" button
4. Verify in database: status=PAID, paid_amount=total_amount, balance_amount=0
5. Click "Revert" button
6. Verify back to: status=UNPAID, paid_amount=0, balance_amount=total

**SQL Verification:**
```sql
SELECT 
    invoice_id, 
    invoice_number,
    status, 
    paid_amount, 
    balance_amount, 
    payment_date
FROM invoices 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### ✓ Invoice Generation
1. Create appointment → mark as COMPLETED
2. Click "Generate Invoice" button
3. Verify:
   - [ ] Unique invoice_number generated (INV-2026-XXXX)
   - [ ] amount = 2000.00
   - [ ] tax = 360.00 (18%)
   - [ ] total_amount = 2360.00
   - [ ] paid_amount = 0.00
   - [ ] balance_amount = 2360.00
   - [ ] status = 'UNPAID'

### ✓ Doctor Earnings Calculation
Navigate to: `/doctor-earnings`

Verify calculation example:
```
Dr. Smith:
  Commission: 35%
  Total Revenue (PAID invoices): ₹100,000.00
  Earning: ₹35,000.00 (visible in table)
```

**SQL Verification:**
```sql
SELECT 
    d.doctor_id,
    d.name,
    d.commission_percentage,
    SUM(i.total_amount) as total_revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(i.total_amount) * d.commission_percentage / 100, 2) as calculated_earning
FROM doctors d
LEFT JOIN invoices i ON d.doctor_id = i.doctor_id AND i.status = 'PAID'
GROUP BY d.doctor_id, d.name, d.commission_percentage;
```

### ✓ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**For DOCTOR role:**
- [ ] Can only see own invoices
- [ ] Doctor filter dropdown NOT visible
- [ ] Cannot see other doctors' invoices
- [ ] Can toggle own invoices only

**For ADMIN role:**
- [ ] See all invoices
- [ ] Doctor filter dropdown visible
- [ ] Can toggle any invoice
- [ ] Full access to all features

**Test DOCTOR access restriction:**
1. Login as Doctor user
2. Try to access `/invoices` → Should see filtered (own only)
3. Try to access another doctor's invoice PDF → Should fail

## Database Verification Queries

### Check Invoice Status Calculations
```sql
-- Verify all invoices have correct balance calculations
SELECT 
    invoice_id,
    invoice_number,
    total_amount,
    paid_amount,
    balance_amount,
    (total_amount - paid_amount) as calculated_balance,
    CASE 
        WHEN (total_amount - paid_amount) = balance_amount THEN 'OK'
        ELSE 'ERROR' 
    END as validation
FROM invoices;
```

### Revenue Summary Verification
```sql
-- Verify revenue totals match dashboard display
SELECT
    'Total Revenue' as metric,
    SUM(total_amount) as amount
FROM invoices 
WHERE status = 'PAID'
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Paid Revenue',
    SUM(paid_amount)
FROM invoices 
WHERE status = 'PAID'
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'Pending Amount',
    SUM(balance_amount)
FROM invoices 
WHERE status = 'UNPAID'
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'This Month Revenue',
    SUM(total_amount)
FROM invoices 
WHERE status = 'PAID' 
  AND MONTH(payment_date) = MONTH(CURDATE())
  AND YEAR(payment_date) = YEAR(CURDATE());
```

### Outstanding Payments
```sql
-- Find all unpaid invoices grouped by customer
SELECT 
    p.name as patient,
    COUNT(i.invoice_id) as unpaid_count,
    SUM(i.balance_amount) as total_outstanding
FROM invoices i
JOIN patients p ON i.patient_id = p.patient_id
WHERE i.status = 'UNPAID'
GROUP BY i.patient_id, p.name
ORDER BY total_outstanding DESC;
```

### Doctor Commission Forecast
```sql
-- Show earning forecast for each doctor
SELECT 
    d.name as doctor,
    d.commission_percentage,
    COUNT(i.invoice_id) as paid_cases,
    SUM(i.total_amount) as total_revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(i.total_amount) * d.commission_percentage / 100, 2) as earning_forecast
FROM doctors d
LEFT JOIN invoices i ON d.doctor_id = i.doctor_id AND i.status = 'PAID'
GROUP BY d.doctor_id, d.name, d.commission_percentage
ORDER BY earning_forecast DESC;
```

---

## Performance Tips

### Recommended Indexes (already created by migration script)
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_number ON invoices(invoice_number);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_status ON invoices(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_created_at ON invoices(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_doctor_id ON invoices(doctor_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_payment_date ON invoices(payment_date);
```

### Query Optimization
The service functions are optimized with:
- Selective column selection (not SELECT *)
- Strategic table JOINs
- WHERE clause filtering
- ORDER BY on indexed columns
- COALESCE for NULL handling

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invoice number is NULL"
**Solution:** Invoice number should be auto-generated on invoice creation. If missing:
```sql
UPDATE invoices 
SET invoice_number = CONCAT('INV-2026-', LPAD(invoice_id, 4, '0'))
WHERE invoice_number IS NULL;
```

### Issue: "Balance amount doesn't match"
**Solution:** Recalculate all balances:
```sql
UPDATE invoices 
SET balance_amount = total_amount - paid_amount
WHERE balance_amount <> (total_amount - paid_amount);
```

### Issue: "PDF download fails"
**Solution:** Ensure reportlab is installed:
```bash
pip install reportlab
```

### Issue: "DOCTOR can see all invoices"
**Solution:** Verify RBAC logic in app.py. Doctor role filters are enforced in service functions.

## Rollback Instructions (if needed)

If you need to revert to the old system:

```sql
-- Remove new columns (WARNING: Data loss!)
ALTER TABLE invoices DROP COLUMN payment_date;
ALTER TABLE invoices DROP COLUMN payment_method;
ALTER TABLE invoices DROP COLUMN paid_amount;
ALTER TABLE invoices DROP COLUMN balance_amount;
ALTER TABLE invoices DROP COLUMN is_active;
ALTER TABLE invoices DROP COLUMN invoice_number;

-- Remove indexes
DROP INDEX idx_invoice_number ON invoices;
DROP INDEX idx_invoice_status ON invoices;
DROP INDEX idx_invoice_created_at ON invoices;
DROP INDEX idx_invoice_doctor_id ON invoices;
DROP INDEX idx_invoice_payment_date ON invoices;

-- Revert app.py and template changes
# (Use git or restore from backup)
```
